 # Adidas Time Series Analysis
 
 ### ADIDAS AG is a multinational corporation, founded and head-quartered in Herzogenaurach, Germany, that designs and manufactures shoes, clothing and accessories. It is the largest sportswear manufacturer in Europe, and the second largest in the world, after Nike. 
 ### In the fiscal year of 2016, ADIDAS generated a total revenue of $19,068 million, increased by 18 percent. In its annual report, ADIDAS projects an annual growth in sale between 11 percent and 13 percent.
 ### For this paper, I used the past quarterly sales data of ADIDAS to forecast its future sales from Q2 of 2017 to Q4 of 2018, applying Time Series Theories to predict whether the goal of ADIDAS can be reached.
